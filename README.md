# Azure ETL & Data Analysis Project - COVID-19 Data Pipeline

Note: The ARM template of the the project for the development branch is contained separately in a private repository and is available to view based on trusted access since it may contain sensitive credential information, however you are still able to view the project description and the insights generated.

ðŸ”¹ Data Extraction and Ingestion: I extracted data from multiple sources, including HTTP endpoints and Azure Blob Storage, to build a comprehensive dataset for COVID-19 analysis. This process helped me gain a solid understanding of working with diverse data sources and the importance of reliable data ingestion strategies.

ðŸ”¹ Data Transformation and Cleaning: I utilized ADF Data Flows and Databricks to perform complex data transformations and cleaning tasks. This was crucial in improving the quality of data, ensuring that the dataset was accurate, complete, and ready for analysis. Through this, I learned the importance of data quality and the need for robust data transformation techniques.

ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization and Insights: Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards and reports that provided valuable insights into COVID-19 trends. This not only honed my skills in data visualization but also reinforced the importance of translating raw data into actionable insights that can drive decision-making.

ðŸ”¹ Data Querying and Analysis: I performed data querying and analysis using SQL in Azure SQL Database, which enhanced my ability to manipulate large datasets and extract meaningful patterns. This was a great learning experience in terms of optimizing queries for performance and scalability.

ðŸ”¹ Automation and CI/CD: To ensure the data was always up-to-date, I implemented automated data refresh schedules using ADF triggers and CI/CD pipelines. This experience underscored the importance of automation in maintaining data pipelines and ensuring consistent, reliable analytics.

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways:

End-to-End Pipeline Mastery: Building an end-to-end data pipeline requires not just technical skills but also an understanding of the entire data lifecycleâ€”from extraction to analysis. Importance of Data Quality: Quality data is the backbone of any analytical project. Investing time in data cleaning and transformation pays off in more accurate and actionable insights. Automation is Key: Automating processes using tools like ADF and CI/CD pipelines saves time and ensures your data remains relevant and up-to-date. Effective Data Visualization: Creating compelling visuals and reports is crucial in communicating insights to stakeholders.

This project has been an incredible journey in exploring the capabilities of Azure services for data analysis, and I am excited to apply these learnings in future projects!
